Description: Twitter has gained increasing worldwide popularity after its launch in 2006. In 2013, there are 58 million tweets per day, with 135,000 new users signing up every day (Statistics Brain, “Twitter Statistics”). The large volume of tweets can encompass huge business value and insight in making business decisions in the background of big data today. In this project, we detect the sentiment of tweets in the financial service industry using supervised machine-learning approach. After collecting 852 tweets that are related to the financial service industry, rule-based quality control is designed to decrease the human error in Twitter sentiment rating. The results using support vector machine (SVM) are promising: we achieve an accuracy of around 70% in a three-category scale (negative/neutral/positive) and 60% in a five-category scale (strongly negative/negative/neutral/positive/strongly positive). After examining the impact of different features, we find out that unigram features contribute the most to the overall accuracy, followed by lexicon features, and then encoding features. Finally, we study different combinations of features applied in different sentiment scales.
